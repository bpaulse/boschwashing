This is a test for the PDF.

I'm trying to use an inline attachment in laravel mail but seems unfortunate. I also tried this one but doesnt work by embeding of raw data. I have a base 64 image/png here is an example of it.

But you are still attempting to display it in the email as a PNG file, correct?
